Welcome to the fourth tutorial! We will try to recreate the graphs from the previous post using Python. I am still a novice on this language so this will be a tutorial in the true sense of the word. First we will perform basic data exploration using pandas and NumPy. 

## Part 1: Basic Data Exploration

Once more we will be using the "USA_data.csv", which you can find on my Research repository, under the databases folder. This database compiles three variables from FRED for the years 1984-2014, espressed in billions USD: 1) Real GDP; 2) Savings; 3) Taxes. Make sure to properly specify your file path when loading the document. 


```python
#we will use the read_csv function to create a data frame called d1:
import pandas as pd
d1 = pd.read_csv("USA_data.csv")
#to make sure we did this correctly we will view the first 3 elements of d1:
d1.head(3)
```



<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Real GDP</th>
      <th>Savings</th>
      <th>Taxes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>1984</td>
      <td>7285.0</td>
      <td>884.5</td>
      <td>425.7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>1985</td>
      <td>7593.8</td>
      <td>884.0</td>
      <td>460.7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>1986</td>
      <td>7860.5</td>
      <td>867.8</td>
      <td>479.8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


We can see our four variables are where they should be. 

```python
#next we will perfom a summary of our dataframe using describe:
d1.describe()
```





<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Real GDP</th>
      <th>Savings</th>
      <th>Taxes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>count</th>
      <td>31.000000</td>
      <td>31.000000</td>
      <td>31.000000</td>
      <td>31.000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>mean</th>
      <td>1999.000000</td>
      <td>11774.558065</td>
      <td>1822.216129</td>
      <td>1072.290323</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>std</th>
      <td>9.092121</td>
      <td>2801.263216</td>
      <td>689.304450</td>
      <td>438.506032</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>min</th>
      <td>1984.000000</td>
      <td>7285.000000</td>
      <td>867.800000</td>
      <td>425.700000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>25%</th>
      <td>1991.500000</td>
      <td>9110.800000</td>
      <td>1155.250000</td>
      <td>653.200000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>50%</th>
      <td>1999.000000</td>
      <td>12065.900000</td>
      <td>1990.600000</td>
      <td>1077.700000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>75%</th>
      <td>2006.500000</td>
      <td>14516.250000</td>
      <td>2262.950000</td>
      <td>1371.000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>max</th>
      <td>2014.000000</td>
      <td>15982.300000</td>
      <td>3337.200000</td>
      <td>1995.000000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


Note that the output is basically the same as in R, showing basic statistics for our data.

```python
#We will now find the mean of just Real GDP 
#notice how the name of the variable goes in brackets after the dataframe d1
(d1["Real GDP"]).mean()
```




    11774.558064516128




```python
#a similar logic applies to find the standard deviation of the savings
(d1["Savings"]).std()
```




    689.3044499574792




```python
#now we will find the median for the taxes series
(d1["Taxes"]).median()
```




    1077.7



Now we will perform a simple aggregation to our dataframe. In this case, we want to add a variable that represents the savings rate as a proportion to the real GDP of the US:


```python
#we will call the new variable we want to add Savings Rate 
```


```python
#we can see from the syntax this is just a vectorial operation
d1["Savings rate"] = d1["Savings"]/d1["Real GDP"]
#now to check if this new variable was added 
d1.head(3)
```




<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Real GDP</th>
      <th>Savings</th>
      <th>Taxes</th>
      <th>Savings rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>1984</td>
      <td>7285.0</td>
      <td>884.5</td>
      <td>425.7</td>
      <td>0.121414</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>1985</td>
      <td>7593.8</td>
      <td>884.0</td>
      <td>460.7</td>
      <td>0.116411</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>1986</td>
      <td>7860.5</td>
      <td>867.8</td>
      <td>479.8</td>
      <td>0.110400</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


The new variable savings_rate has been added to our d1 dataframe!


```python
#to finish we will find the mean savings proportion for this time period:
(d1["Savings rate"].mean())*100
```




    14.983051715411833



## Part 2: Simple plots using matplotlib

Now we will try to recreate basic scatterplots using matplotlib, which is the ["most basic library for visualizing data graphically"](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-data-visualization-with-python-2dd74df12b5e). To start we will do a basic scatterplot between Taxes on the x-axis and Real GDP on the y-axis. Make sure that you have matplotlib installed before doing this:


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#just to shorten our sintax we will create variables x and y, with Taxes and Real GDP respectively:
x = d1["Taxes"]
y = d1["Real GDP"]
#now for the basic plot
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color='midnightblue')
#Note how we specified the "o" which stipulates dots on the plot. A
#dditionally, the color name was added, which is one of my favorites for plots if you recall the previous post.
#Since we want to export this plot to GitHub, we must save the plot as a png file:
plt.savefig('pyplot1.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
#now we can add the show() to see the plot:
plt.show()
```


![scatter plot 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post4_p1.png)


Suppose we now wanted to add axis labels and a title to our plot. Additionally, we wanted to add a linear regression line **without** using other libraries. As I am still a novice, a direct but also clumsy solution would be to create the elements of the trendline using the [NumPy polyfit funtion](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html) and then adding these elements to our scatterplot:


```python
#this is our base plot 
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color='midnightblue')
#we import numpy
import numpy as np
#we use the polyfit funtion, with the independent and dependent, 
#followed by the order of the polynomial
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
#now we add the trendline by altering our "y" variable
plt.plot(x, m*x + b, color="firebrick")
#everything else is the same 
plt.xlabel('Taxes in billions(USD)')
plt.ylabel('Real GDP in billions(USD)')
plt.title('Relationship between taxes and real GDP (1984-2014)')
#saving the plot 
plt.savefig('pyplot2.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
#now we can add the show() to see the plot:
plt.show()
```


    
![scatter plot 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post4_p2.png)
    


## Part 3: Exploring plots with Seaborn
Python has a couple of libraries to choose from, but in this last section we will use [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html), an extension of Matplotlib. The syntax is similar to what we have been doing so far and the plots are quite elegant. 


```python
#note that for seaborn we will use the original names of our variables so that they are not interpreted as arguments:
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()
#now we can use the Seaborn regplot function:
sns.set_style("dark")
sns.regplot(x="Taxes",
            y="Real GDP", 
            ci=None,data=d1,
            color="midnightblue",line_kws={"color":"firebrick","lw":2})
#extra customization
plt.title('Relationship between taxes and real GDP (1984-2014)')
#saving the plot 
plt.savefig('pyplot3.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
#now we can add the show() to see the plot:
plt.show()
```


![scatter plot 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post4_p3.png)

    


Lastly, we will try to use one of the built-in themes to do a "fancier" plot, [which mimics FiveThirtyEight](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/). The results so far have been more than acceptable, without needing too much customization. In this case we will redo the second plot but ask Python to use a given style:


```python
#importing the style functionality
import matplotlib.style as style
#we must ask Python to use this FiveThirtyEight style theme for our plot 
style.use('fivethirtyeight')
#this is our base plot 
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color='midnightblue')
#we import numpy
import numpy as np
#we use the polyfit funtion, with the independent and dependent, followed by the order of the polynomial
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
#now we add the trendline by altering our "y" variable
plt.plot(x, m*x + b, color="firebrick")
#everything else is the same 
plt.xlabel('Taxes in billions(USD)')
plt.ylabel('Real GDP in billions(USD)')
plt.title('Relationship between taxes and real GDP (1984-2014)')
#saving our plot
plt.savefig('pyplot4.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
#now we can add the show() to see the plot:
plt.show()
```



If you did everything correctly, your plot should look like the one above. Clearly, I am being a bit lazy by not diving deeper into more customization, but this is my first time using any of these plots, so not a bad start!

## Conclusions
In this tutorial we have seen how use Python to perform basic data exploration of a .csv file. We also took what was once a simple scatterplot and turned it into a much more professional plot. This is only an introduction to visualization in Python and there are plenty of resources available online to dive into. Thanks for coming along!
