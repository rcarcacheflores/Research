A summary of our recent article has been published in the [42nd Edition of FundsPeople Portugal](https://fundspeople.com/pt/revista/revista-fundspeople-42-os-fundos-com-rating-fundspeople-2022/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=&utm_term=&utm_content=). Unfortunately, the article is only in Portuguese, but it's a nice introduction to the work we have been doing at VITALIS.
