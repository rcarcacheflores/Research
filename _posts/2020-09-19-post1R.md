I will keep things very simple in this first tutorial about the basics
with R. The objective is just to get familiar with the syntax and the
way objects are constructed. This is also a tutorial for me since I am
just getting used to working with R Markdown and Github simultaneously.

Part 1: Basic Calculations
--------------------------

In this section we will look use R as a simple calculator. We will also
introduce a few basic built-in functions:

``` r
#first we will perform basic math:
2+2
```

    ## [1] 4

``` r
6-1
```

    ## [1] 5

``` r
4*8
```

    ## [1] 32

``` r
#we can also perform more complex operations using ()
((81/9)^2)+20
```

    ## [1] 101

``` r
#now we will use some basic functions, starting with the square root
sqrt(64)
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
#note that in R the syntax is quite direct, we call the function(argument)

#for ln(36) we do:
log(36)
```

    ## [1] 3.583519

``` r
#suppose we wanted to change the base to find log(36), i.e. base 10
log(36,10)
```

    ## [1] 1.556303

Part 2: Working with Vectors
----------------------------

In this section we will use R to construct and manipulate vectors, which
are essentially data objects with one dimension. Since R is an object
oriented language, I find this task to be a bit easier than with Python.

``` r
#first we will create a vector called x which takes these numbers: 
x <- c(45,31,60,80,32)
#to see the contents of the vector we simply call for x:
x
```

    ## [1] 45 31 60 80 32

``` r
#to find the mean we can use the function mean():
mean(x)
```

    ## [1] 49.6

``` r
#for the standard deviation we simply do sd():
sd(x)
```

    ## [1] 20.67124

``` r
#now suppose we want to create another vector called y:
y <- c(28,90,45,60,70)
#we can add the elements in their given order of these vectors by doing:
x+y
```

    ## [1]  73 121 105 140 102

``` r
#the same works with multiplication:
x*y
```

    ## [1] 1260 2790 2700 4800 2240

``` r
##finally, we can create the vector z which adds x and y and get its mean:
z <- x+y
mean(z)
```

    ## [1] 108.2

Part 3: Working with Matrices
--------------------------

For this last section we will work with matrices using R. The logic is a
bit different since matrices have their own special codes. In this
section we will perform a bit of basic linear algebra which can serve
for more complex analysis:

``` r
#first we will create matrix a 2x3 matrix called a:
a <- matrix(c(1,4,2,5,3,6), nrow = 2)
#note that we stipulate the matrix base and also the number of rows which shows in the following:
a
```

    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
    ## [1,]    1    2    3
    ## [2,]    4    5    6

``` r
#next we will create a 3x2 matrix called b:
b <- matrix(c(6,-1,8,23,7,9), nrow = 3)

#to perform matrix multiplication we imput:
a%*%b
```

    ##      [,1] [,2]
    ## [1,]   28   64
    ## [2,]   67  181

``` r
#note that the order is very important here for the multiplication to work

#for more complex operations we can create a 3x3 matrix called c:
c <- matrix(c(1,2,9,8,5,4,10,11,12), nrow = 3)
#to find the inverse of c we use solve()
solve(c)
```

    ##             [,1]       [,2]        [,3]
    ## [1,]  0.06504065 -0.2276423  0.15447154
    ## [2,]  0.30487805 -0.3170732  0.03658537
    ## [3,] -0.15040650  0.2764228 -0.04471545

``` r
#to find the determinant of c we use det()
det(c)
```

    ## [1] 246

Conclusions
-----------

I hope this first post was useful if you have never used R before and
were curious about the language. In the next post I will redo this
exercise using Python and highlight a few key differences in the syntax.


Thank you for coming along on the start of this journey!
