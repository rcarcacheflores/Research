Welcome to the fourth tutorial, now comes the interesting part. We will try to recreate the graphs from the previous post using Python. I am still a novice on this language so this will be a tutorial in the true sense of the word. First we will perform basic data exploration using pandas and NumPy. 

## Part 1: Basic Data Exploration

Once more we will be using the "USA_data.csv". This database compiles three variables from FRED for the years 1984-2014, espressed in billions USD: 1) Real GDP; 2) Savings; 3) Taxes. Make sure to properly specify your file path when loading the document. 


```python
#we will use the read_csv function to create a data frame called d1:
import pandas as pd
d1 = pd.read_csv("USA_data.csv")
#to make sure we did this correctly we will view the first 3 elements of d1:
d1.head(3)
```

```python
#Note that the output is basically the same as in R. We will now find the mean of just Real GDP 
#notice how the name of the variable goes in brackets after the dataframe d1
(d1["Real GDP"]).mean()
```




    11774.558064516128




```python
#a similar logic applies to find the standard deviation of the savings
(d1["Savings"]).std()
```




    689.3044499574792




```python
#now we will find the median for the taxes series
(d1["Taxes"]).median()
```




    1077.7



Now we will perform a simple aggregation to our dataframe. In this case we want to add a variable that represents the savings rate as a proportion to the real GDP of the US:


```python
#we will call the new variable we want to add Savings Rate 
```


```python
#we can see from the syntax this is just a vectorial operation
d1["Savings rate"] = d1["Savings"]/d1["Real GDP"]
#now to check if this new variable was added 
d1.head(3)
```

      <td>7285.0</td>

```python
#to finish we will find the mean savings proportion for this time period:
(d1["Savings rate"].mean())*100
```

## Part 2: Simple plots using matplotlib

Now we will try to recreate basic scatterplots using matplotlib, which is the most "most basic library for visualizing data graphically". To start we will do a basic scatterplot between Taxes on the x-axis and Real GDP on the y-axis. Make sure that you have the matplotlib installed before doing this. N 


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#just to shorten our sintax we will create variables x and y, with Taxes and Real GDP respectively:
x = d1["Taxes"]
y = d1["Real GDP"]
#now for the basic plot
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color='midnightblue')
#Note how we specified the "o" which stipulates dots on the plot. A
#dditionally, the color name was added, which is one of my favorites for plots if you recall the previous post.
#Since we want to export this plot to GitHub, we must save the plot as a png file:
plt.savefig('pyplot1.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
#now we can add the show() to see the plot:
plt.show()
```


    
![png](2020-10-02_files/2020-10-02_12_0.png)
    


Suppose we now wanted to add axis labels and a title to our plot. Additionally, we wanted to add a linear regression line **without** using other libraries. As I am still a novice, a direct but also clumsy solution would be to create the elements of the trendline using the NumPy polyfit funtion and then adding these elements to our scatterplot:


```python
#this is our base plot 
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color='midnightblue')
#we import numpy
import numpy as np
#we use the polyfit funtion, with the independent and dependent, followed by the order of the polynomial
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
#now we add the trendline by altering our "y" variable
plt.plot(x, m*x + b, color="firebrick")
#everything else is the same 
plt.xlabel('Taxes in billions(USD)')
plt.ylabel('Real GDP in billions(USD)')
plt.title('Relationship between taxes and real GDP (1984-2014)')
#saving the plot 
plt.savefig('pyplot2.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
#now we can add the show() to see the plot:
plt.show()
```


    
![png](2020-10-02_files/2020-10-02_14_0.png)
    


## Part 3: Exploring more advanced plot libraries
In this last section we will explore a couple of more advanced libraries. Unlike R, where ggplot2 is the standard go-to package for plotting, Python has multiple libraries to choose from. For an extensive tutorial on different libraries see...We will start by using Seaborn, a library based on Matplotlib:


```python
#note that for seaborn we will use the original names of our variables so that they are not interpreted as arguments
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()
#now we can use the Seaborn regplot function, which has a different syntax than before
sns.set_style("dark")
sns.regplot(x="Taxes",
            y="Real GDP", 
            ci=None,data=d1,
            color="midnightblue",line_kws={"color":"firebrick","lw":2})
#extra customization
plt.title('Relationship between taxes and real GDP (1984-2014)')
#saving the plot 
plt.savefig('pyplot3.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
#now we can add the show() to see the plot:
plt.show()
```


    
![png](2020-10-02_files/2020-10-02_16_0.png)
    


Lastly, we will try to use one of the built-in themes to do a "fancier" plot. The results so far have been more than acceptable, without needing too much customization. In this case we will redo the second plot but ask Python to use a given style:


```python
#importing the style functionality
import matplotlib.style as style
#we must ask Python to use this FiveThirtyEight style theme for our plot 
style.use('fivethirtyeight')
#this is our base plot 
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color='midnightblue')
#we import numpy
import numpy as np
#we use the polyfit funtion, with the independent and dependent, followed by the order of the polynomial
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
#now we add the trendline by altering our "y" variable
plt.plot(x, m*x + b, color="firebrick")
#everything else is the same 
plt.xlabel('Taxes in billions(USD)')
plt.ylabel('Real GDP in billions(USD)')
plt.title('Relationship between taxes and real GDP (1984-2014)')
#saving our plot
plt.savefig('pyplot4.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
#now we can add the show() to see the plot:
plt.show()
```


    
![png](2020-10-02_files/2020-10-02_18_0.png)
    


If you did everything correctly, your plot should look like the one above. Clearly, I am being a bit lazy by not diving deeper into more customization, but this is my first time using any of these plots, so it's not a bad start!

## Conclusions
In this tutorial we have seen how to perform basic data exploration of a cv. We also took what was once a simple scatterplot and turned it into a much more professional plot. This is only an introduction to visualization in Python and I hope to present more elaborate techniques in future posts. Thanks for coming along!
