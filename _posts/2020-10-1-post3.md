In this short tutorial we will perform basic data exploration and more
complex visualization techniques using packages like ggplot2. The
objective is to showcase R’s flexibility for presenting customizable
content.

Part 1: Basic Data Exploration
------------------------------

For this exercise, we will be using a simple file called
“USA\_data.csv”. This database compiles three variables for the years
1984-2014, espressed in billions USD: 1) Real GDP; 2) Savings; 3) Taxes.

The data was collected from FRED and was used in a SEM model I performed
a few years ago. The first step is to download the data from my
repository and then load it to R. Make sure that the folder your file is
in matches your directory in R:

``` r
#just checking our current directory:
getwd()
```

    ## [1] "/...Documents/Research with R and Python"

``` r
#it matches where the file is stored so we can open the file and call it d1:
d1 <- read.csv("USA_data.csv")
#for a basic summary of our data we can simply do:
summary(d1)
```

    ##     ï..Year        Real.GDP        Savings           Taxes       
    ##  Min.   :1984   Min.   : 7285   Min.   : 867.8   Min.   : 425.7  
    ##  1st Qu.:1992   1st Qu.: 9111   1st Qu.:1155.2   1st Qu.: 653.2  
    ##  Median :1999   Median :12066   Median :1990.6   Median :1077.7  
    ##  Mean   :1999   Mean   :11775   Mean   :1822.2   Mean   :1072.3  
    ##  3rd Qu.:2006   3rd Qu.:14516   3rd Qu.:2262.9   3rd Qu.:1371.0  
    ##  Max.   :2014   Max.   :15982   Max.   :3337.2   Max.   :1995.0

From the summary we can see basic statistics for our four variables. One
minor issue is that the Year variable apparently was not coded
correctly, so we can adjust this using base functions by doing:

``` r
#first we can check the column names for our data:
colnames(d1)
```

    ## [1] "ï..Year"  "Real.GDP" "Savings"  "Taxes"

``` r
#Rename column where names is "1..Year"
names(d1)[names(d1) == "ï..Year"] <- "Year"
#checking if it worked
colnames(d1)
```

    ## [1] "Year"     "Real.GDP" "Savings"  "Taxes"

Now we can conduct some basic descriptive statistics for our data:

``` r
#Suppose we wanted the mean of just the Real GDP, we use $:
mean(d1$Real.GDP)
```

    ## [1] 11774.56

``` r
#same logic if we wanted the standard deviation of the Savings
sd(d1$Savings)
```

    ## [1] 689.3044

``` r
#conversely we can attach our data, which makes accessing each variable easier
attach(d1)
#note that this is not recommended if you are working with multiple datasets

#to find the median in the taxes, i.e. the 50% quantile
median(Taxes)
```

    ## [1] 1077.7

Since every variable is being interpreted as a numeric vector, we can
perform similar operations as in the previous tutorial. Suppose we
wanted to create the real yearly savings rate as a proportion of the
real GDP:

``` r
#we can add the new variable to our data in one go doing:
d1$savings_rate <- Savings/Real.GDP
#verifying that we have another variable:
colnames(d1)
```

    ## [1] "Year"         "Real.GDP"     "Savings"      "Taxes"       
    ## [5] "savings_rate"

``` r
#checking the national mean savings proportion for the period:
mean(d1$savings_rate)*100
```

    ## [1] 14.98305

``` r
#the savings seems to be about 15% of the real GDP for this period
```

Part 2: Simple Built-in Plots
-----------------------------

Suppose we wanted to explore the relationship between Real GDP and taxes
in the United States. In order to do this, we can perform the
correlation between both variables and also make a scatter plot to
visualize this relationship:

``` r
#for a simple correlation test we can perform 
cor.test(Real.GDP, Taxes)
```

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation
    ## 
    ## data:  Real.GDP and Taxes
    ## t = 19.229, df = 29, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.9238369 0.9821652
    ## sample estimates:
    ##       cor 
    ## 0.9629522

``` r
#we reject the null, and see that there is positive correlation between both variables. 
#This clearly makes sense from a national accounts perspective
```

Next we can do a basic plot, recall our database is still “attached”

``` r
#now we can use the built-in plot function to generate the most basic scatterplot
plot(Taxes, Real.GDP)
```

![](/_posts/post3_p1.png)

Note that the order of the imput matters, as Taxes were added automatically to the x-axis and Real.GDP is interpreted in the y axes.
Clearly this is a very simple plot, but we can customize it in the following way:

``` r
#just performing an initial linear regression of taxes explaining GDP:
reg <- lm(d1$Real.GDP ~ d1$Taxes)
#changing point shape to filled circles (pch = 19) and adding a title:
plot(Taxes, Real.GDP, main = "Relationship between taxes and real GDP in the US",
     xlab = "Taxes in billions USD", ylab = "Real GDP in billions USD",
     pch = 19, col="midnightblue")
#adding our trend line to the plot 
abline(reg, col = "firebrick", lwd=2)
```

![](/_posts/post3_p2.png)

That is a nicer plot. Note that we also specified the R colors for the
points (midnightblue) and for the line (firebrick). This is completely
optional but I always like how the combination works. Now we will finish
with a more robust approach using ggplot.

Part 3: A More Robust Approach with ggplot2
-------------------------------------------

This is by no means intended to be a tutorial on ggplot2, that in itself
is an online course. Here is a nice [introduction to the ggplot syntax](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html).
Instead I will merely look to replicate and enhance the plot we have
worked on.

``` r
#we call for the package using library(), make sure it is installed first
library(ggplot2)
```
``` r
#the base code for a ggplot2 scatter plot would be:
ggplot(d1,aes(x=Taxes,y=Real.GDP))+geom_point(col="midnightblue") 
```
![](/_posts/post3_p3.png)


Note that we specify the “geom” we want to use for our plot, in this
case points. A nice thing about ggplot2 is that we can save our plots as
objects and configure them as we go along:

``` r
#first we will save the plot above and call it p1
p1 <- ggplot(d1,aes(x=Taxes,y=Real.GDP))+geom_point(col="midnightblue", size=1.5) 
#now we will customize this plot and add our trendline along with other nice elements
p1 + geom_smooth(method = lm,se=FALSE, col="firebrick", size=1.2)+ 
ylab(c("Real GDP in billions USD"))+xlab(c("Taxes in billions USD"))+ 
ggtitle(c("Relationship between taxes and real GDP in the US"))
```

![](/_posts/post3_p4.png)

That is a nicer plot! Still, we can do even more using the package
[“ggthemes” which allows for even more customization](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-themes-and-background-colors-the-3-elements). There are also
built-in themes for lazy people like me, which “reflect” other themes.
Let us try *The Economist* theme, since we are dealing with economic
data:

``` r
library(ggthemes)
```
``` r
#we will create another plot object with minor updates 
p2 <- p1 + geom_smooth(method = lm,se=FALSE, col="firebrick", size=1.2)+ ylab(c("Real GDP in billions(USD)"))+
xlab(c("Taxes in billions(USD)"))+ labs(title="Relationship between taxes and real GDP in the US", caption = "Source: FRED")
#the syntax is similar so we just call our second plot and add the theme
p2+theme_economist()
```

![](/_posts/post3_p5.png)

That looks like the real deal!



Conclusions
-----------

We have seen very basic data exploration in R. From the plot above it is
also clear the powerful visualization ggplot2 offers to transform an
ordinary scatterplot into quite an impressive graph. This is merely
sratching the surface. In the next post I will replicate this exercise
(hopefully) using Python.
