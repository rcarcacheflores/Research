I haven't been able to post in a few months, mainly due to my current workload. I'm very happy to share that we presented a paper titled "A new approach to Markowitz portfolio optimization using ruin-based outcomes", at the Joint Section Virtual Colloquium of the International Actuarial Association. This is my first bit of published research in quantitative finance. It was a great honor to present alongside industry leaders and academic experts. Here is a [link](https://www.actuaries.org/iaa/October2021_Joint_Col/Event_Details/October2021_Joint_Col/Event_Details.aspx?hkey=19abd5a0-492b-4875-9e2b-6b40edddf146) where you can find my slides, along with the rest of the presentations. I will try to post the paper once it is available. Overall, I'm very grateful to be able to do research like this at VITALIS.
