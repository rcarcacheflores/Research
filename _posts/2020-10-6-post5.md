I think it’s time to post some actual research! So here is a bit of
context to this post. My Bachelor’s degree was in Economics, but it was
tough for me to follow the more theoretical classes. Things changed in
my fourth year, when I took Econometrics. Just being able to model and
apply what little I knew into friendly statistical programs felt great.
So, once I finished those courses I wanted to keep going. I downloaded a
nice data base for the [Global Food Security
Index(GFSI)](https://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com) and made a simple logit
to model obesity. A few months later I was able to get it published in
my [university’s Economics
Department](http://www.uca.edu.sv/economia/2018-boletin-economia-hoy/).
Ok, enough storytelling, let’s model!

Part 1: Data exploration
------------------------

The database we’ll use is called “gsfi\_logit.csv” and has already been
cleaned and prepared. It contains the averages of each variable taken
from the GFSI for the years 2012-2017. I didn’t use the yearly data in
panel format because there were replicate observations for some of the
variables. Therefore, what we have are averages for 112 countries (one
country was removed as an outlier) during this short time period. The
variables are coded as follow: 
1. obesity - represents an estimate of the national prevalence of obesity 
as a percentage of the total population. 
2. PPC - stands for GDP per capita. 
3. KCAL - an estimate of the average daily calorie intake for a person in a given country. 
4. div - an estimate of the dietary diversification, given as a percentage. 
Countries with higher values of div have diets comprised of more varied food groups. 
5. poverty - percentage of the population living below the global poverty line. 
6. consumption - the average spent on consumption as a proportion of a household’s income in a given
country. 
7. popdens - is a country’s population density, taken from the World Bank. 
8. OECD - binary variable which takes the value of 1 if a country belongs to this group.

Time to explore the data:

``` r
#We will open the database and call it d1:
d1 <- read.csv("gsfi_logit.csv")
#now we perform a summary for our data:
summary(d1)
```

I developed a classification rule for the obesity variable. I took the
mean value for all the countries (16.09) and made a binary variable.
Those countries with obesity levels above the global mean were coded
with 1, while those below the mean were given a 0:

``` r
#first we will create a null variable in our d1 database:
d1$obesd <- NULL
#now we generate the classification rule:
d1$obesd[d1$obesity>16.09]=1
d1$obesd[d1$obesity<=16.09]=0
#next we can code it as a factor:
d1$obesd <- factor(d1$obesd)
#to check how this obesity dummy is distributed we can use table():
table(d1$obesd)
```

    ## 
    ##  0  1 
    ## 48 64

``` r
#it is more or less balanced, 64 countries are above the global mean
```

Applying what we saw in the previous posts, we can do a nice graph to
visualize possible relationships between our variables. We will perform
a scatter plot of KCAL and GDP per capita, which also integrates our
obesity variable:

``` r
#we first load ggplot2:
library(ggplot2)
#here is our basic plot and we shade our points according to obesity prevalence:
p1 <- ggplot(d1,aes(x=KCAL,y=PPC,color=obesity))+ geom_point(size=2)
#set up the color gradient with the most obese countries in red:
p2 <- p1 + scale_color_gradient(low = "steelblue", high = "red", name="Obesity prevalence(%)")
#we add a trend line, change the labels, and add a classic theme:
p2 + geom_smooth(method = lm,se=FALSE, col="darkorange")+ 
  ylab(c("GDP per capita"))+xlab(c("Average daily calorie intake per person"))+ 
  ggtitle(c("Obesity prevalence in countries by GDP and daily KCAL consumption"))+
  theme_classic()
```

![](2020-10-7-post5_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

From our graph we can deduce the following: 
1. Countries with higher GDP per capita seem to have a higher average daily calorie intake per
person. 
2. Obesity prevalence seems to have a positive relationship with
the average daily calorie intake and possibly with a country’s GDP per capita.

Now it’s time to evaluate these theories using our logit model!

Part 2: Setting up our logit model
----------------------------------

This part is relatively straigthforward. R has a built-in glm function
which allows us to perform different models within the GLM framework.
For a nice overview of GLM visit this
[course](http://www.john-ros.com/Rcourse/glm.html). We will start by
recoding the OECD variable into a factor:

``` r
#we set our OECD variable as a factor:
d1$OECD <- factor(d1$OECD)
#now we perform our logit and save it as logit1:
logit1 <- glm(obesd ~ PPC + KCAL + div + poverty + 
                consumption + popdens + OECD, data = d1,
              family = "binomial"(link=logit))
#we do a summary of our first logit:
summary(logit1)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## glm(formula = obesd ~ PPC + KCAL + div + poverty + consumption + 
    ##     popdens + OECD, family = binomial(link = logit), data = d1)
    ## 
    ## Deviance Residuals: 
    ##     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  
    ## -2.4075  -0.1955   0.1363   0.2592   2.0979

    ## OECD1       -2.654e+00  1.413e+00  -1.879   0.0603 .

    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
    ## 
    ## (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)

    ## Residual deviance:  51.53  on 104  degrees of freedom

    ## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 7

The summary of our first logit gives useful information on which
regressors are statistically significant. In this case KCAL and div are
the most significant, followed by the OECD dummy variable. We can use
the anova function to determine if we should remove some of the other
regressors based on the chi-squared criteria:

``` r
#here is the syntax for our deviance test:
anova(logit1, test="Chisq")
```

    ## Analysis of Deviance Table

    ## popdens      1    2.147       105     55.176   0.14285    
    ## OECD         1    3.646       104     51.530   0.05621 .  
    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

According to this result we could consider removing consumption, and
population density. Let’s try to do so and see if we get better results:

``` r
#here we will generate our logit:
logit2 <- glm(obesd ~ PPC + KCAL + div + poverty + OECD, data = d1,
              family = "binomial"(link=logit))
#this time we will just test the deviance:
anova(logit1,logit2)
```

    ## Analysis of Deviance Table
    ## 
    ## Model 1: obesd ~ PPC + KCAL + div + poverty + consumption + popdens + 
    ##     OECD
    ## Model 2: obesd ~ PPC + KCAL + div + poverty + OECD
    ##   Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance
    ## 1       104     51.530            
    ## 2       106     54.709 -2  -3.1786

The second model does not show an improvement in terms of deviance. This
is just one comparison criteria, but for now will stick to the first
model that includes all our regressors.

Part 3: Making predictions with our logit model
-----------------------------------------------

In this last section we will use our logit to make predictions. The
first thing we will do is see how accurate our first logit model was in
predicting countries with obesity prevalence above the global mean:

``` r
#we create a confusion matrix to see our model accuracy:
table(true=d1$obesd,pred=round(logit1$fitted.values))
```

    ##     pred
    ## true  0  1
    ##    0 42  6
    ##    1  3 61

From the confusion matrix we need to focus on the diagonal. We can see
we correctly predicted about 92% of the cases. Of course, with more data
we could generate a training and testing subset. For now, suppose we
wanted to focus on predicting above average obesity levels for the OECD
countries, one of the variables which was statistically significant:

``` r
#first we have to hold constant the means for our other variables and create a new data frame, 
#where we must keep the original names for each variable:
d2 <- with(d1, data.frame(PPC = mean(PPC), KCAL = mean(KCAL), 
                                    div = mean(div),
                                    poverty = mean(poverty),
                                    consumption = mean(consumption),
                                    popdens = mean(popdens),
                                    OECD = factor(0:1)))
#now we generate the probailities
d2$OECD_pred <- predict(logit1, newdata = d2, type = "response")
d2
```

    ##       PPC     KCAL      div  poverty consumption  popdens OECD OECD_pred
    ## 1 18622.8 2835.582 51.03839 25.99145    30.07974 209.7526    0 0.7347762
    ## 2 18622.8 2835.582 51.03839 25.99145    30.07974 209.7526    1 0.1631682

We can see from our prediction table that **non-OECD countries show
significantly higher probabilities of having obesity prevalence above
the global mean!**. This result will be highligted in the following
graph, its basic syntax was [taken from
here](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/logit-regression/):

``` r
#for this graph we want to see how KCAL intake is related to 
#obesity probabilites obtained, along with the OECD grouping:
d3 <- with(d1, data.frame(KCAL = rep(seq(from = 1600, to = 3800, 
                                         length.out = 56),2), div= mean(div),
                                    PPC = mean(PPC),
                                    poverty = mean(poverty),
                                    consumption = mean(consumption),
                                    popdens = mean(popdens),
                                    OECD = factor(rep(0:1, each = 56))))
#now we will predict using the link scale:
d3 <- cbind(d3, predict(logit1, newdata = d3, type = "link",
                                    se = TRUE))
#now we include the residuals and Upper and Lower Confidence Levels:
d3 <- within(d3, {
  Probability <- plogis(fit)
  LCL <- plogis(fit - (1.96 * se.fit))
  UCL <- plogis(fit + (1.96 * se.fit))
})

#now we can generate our graph:
p3 <- ggplot(d3, aes(x = KCAL, y = Probability)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = LCL, ymax = UCL, fill = OECD), alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_line(aes(colour = OECD), size = 1)

#extra customization for our plot:
p3 + ylab(c("Probability of having obesity levels above the global mean"))+
  xlab(c("Average daily calorie intake per person"))+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("firebrick","midnightblue"),
                                         labels=c("Non-member", "Member country"))+
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("firebrick","midnightblue"),
                      labels=c("Non-member", "Member country"))+
  labs(caption = "Data extracted from GFSI/Economist Intellegence Unit")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 7, face = "italic")) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = (median(d3$KCAL)), color="darkorange")
```

![](2020-10-7-post5_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)
Median KCAL is 2700 calories

The shift is quite pronounced! From this plot we can see there is a
positive relationship between the average daily calorie intake and the
probability of a country having obesity levels higher than the global
mean. This is to be expected. What is surprising is that for non-OECD
countries, there is a higher probability of having above average obesity
levels **for any KCAL level**, ceteris paribus. What could this mean?
One interpretation is that the **quality** of the calories consumed in
non-OECD countries is poor compared to that of OECD countries. Lastly,
we will do the same graph for the dietary diversification and see if the
results hold:

``` r
#for this graph we want to see how diterary diversification is related to 
#obesity probabilites obtained, along with the OECD grouping:
d4 <- with(d1, data.frame(div = rep(seq(from = 19, to = 76, 
                                         length.out = 56),2), KCAL= mean(KCAL),
                                    PPC = mean(PPC),
                                    poverty = mean(poverty),
                                    consumption = mean(consumption),
                                    popdens = mean(popdens),
                                    OECD = factor(rep(0:1, each = 56))))
#now we will predict using the link scale:
d4 <- cbind(d4, predict(logit1, newdata = d4, type = "link",
                                    se = TRUE))
#now we include the residuals and Upper and Lower Confidence Levels:
d4 <- within(d4, {
  Probability <- plogis(fit)
  LCL <- plogis(fit - (1.96 * se.fit))
  UCL <- plogis(fit + (1.96 * se.fit))
})
#now we can generate our graph:
p4 <- ggplot(d4, aes(x = div, y = Probability)) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = LCL,
                          ymax = UCL, fill = OECD), alpha = 0.2) + 
                          geom_line(aes(colour = OECD), size = 1)
#extra customization for our plot: 
p4 + ylab(c("Probability of having obesity levels above the global mean"))+
xlab(c("Average dietary diversification (100% being the most diversified)"))+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("firebrick","midnightblue"),
                                         labels=c("Non-member", "Member country"))+
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("firebrick","midnightblue"),
                      labels=c("Non-member", "Member country"))+
  labs(caption = "Data extracted from GFSI/Economist Intellegence Unit")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 7, face = "italic"))+ 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 50, color="darkorange")
```

![](2020-10-7-post5_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

The results are very similar when it comes to the dietary
diversification. Higher dietary diversification implies a higher
probability for a country to have obesity levels above the global mean.
Additionally, there is an even more pronounced difference between OECD
countries and non-OECD countries.

Conclusions
-----------

Least developed countries have a higher probability of having obesity
levels above the global mean, all things equal for these two variables.
While it is a short time period, this study seems to imply that the
quantity of KCAL or degree of dietary diversification is not in itself a
cause for higher obesity levels. The true issue probably lies in the
**quality of food** accessible for least developed countries. These
hubmle finding are still relevant in this global pandemic, as early
studies have shown an [alarming relationship between obesity and
COVID-19
mortality](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2020/08/26/obesity-linked-with-higher-risk-for-covid-19-complications/).
We must continue to study this global health issue, without losing sight
of the inequalities present between countries.
