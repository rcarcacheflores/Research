My name is Roberto Carcache Flores. My Bachelor's degree was in Economics, with a focus on Econometrics. Currently, I am in the second year of an MSc in Actuarial Science at the University of Lisbon, faculty ISEG. I have past work experience in the public sector and academia. During the last two years, I've worked as a consultant/research assistant in a regional project led by John Jay College, CUNY. In this blog I will publish some of my past research along with tutorials using R and hopefully Python, which I am starting to learn. I will try to make all data avaiable in my repository. You can reach me at rcarcacheflores@outlook.com for any queries.
